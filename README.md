# Fantasy-Points

Model for predicting fantasy points a player will have<br />
Data in Original.xlsx found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/sample-data/NFL%20Offensive%20Player%20stats,%201999-2013.xlsx)
Data sourced from [pro-football-reference.com](https://www.pro-football-reference.com)
The data from pro-football-reference is messy, but seemingly not for core yardage/scoring stats.
One interesting value that pro-football-reference itself has but is missing from Original.xlsx is times a receiver was targeted.
